Scripts here call the update routines.

... uninstall, reset, pull, install....

Every app in this repo comes with an install script, a apt-dependency list and an update script. The apt lists are currently /opt/ITSEC-Install-Scripts/0.Initial/lst/apt/ .
The install and update scripts reside within the " /opt/ITSEC-Install-Scripts" mai ncategories.

Scripts here call /opt/ITSEC-Install-Scripts * categories "appname-update.sh" files to run the udpate routines and update all the things at one. The apt lists currently dont apear in the isntall scripts biut in the main stallation routine - probably flipped over anytime.

The update scripts here will be also linked to the console - goal to update allthethings easypeasy - neat eh :)
