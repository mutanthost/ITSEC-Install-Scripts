# Latest issues/news, bugs whatever ....

added a nvm (node version manager) install script to later replace node git for install/setup speed reasons 

/opt/ITSEC-Install-Scripts/0.Initial/2.sh

the script(s) locate here: /opt/ITSEC-Install-Scripts/0.Initial/src/PT2/

its a 2 part script bec it needs a fresh terminal in the middle of the script and i couldnt figure how to do it in one script.
For this reason its not part of the install routine to replace node git yet. Feel free to push or comment changes. Goal is node version managent, else ill figure a way with node sources off their site.
