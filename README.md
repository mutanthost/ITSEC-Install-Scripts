Leave comments in the issues for suggestions on changes FE remove, add apps, change/add/remove categories or whatever - (id love to read some - im not a pentester, just a linux lover with interst in itsec and curious in general :) )

## # Welcome to the ITSEC-Install-Scripts wiki!

### 1. Whats this?

- Menu screens (outdated)...

https://github.com/alphaaurigae/ITSEC-Install-Scripts/wiki/Menu-Screenshots-as-of-12.7.17

Its a pain to go through centillions of clicks just to setup your linux OS to the same state just before you broke it or to spawn just another VM.

Fortunately theres bash to help us :) ...

Unfortunately its still a few clicks away to have this awesome template you can use, those pre build Oses ala kali arent an option too eventually ...
 one maybe want git sources and decide own branches, be upto date all the time && flexible and everything custom - ah and for the lazy pls - who wants to waste lots of time on this :) ...

Since its super simple, everybody from bash beginner like me to code ninja can use it for whatever purpose.
In the docs folder you can find documentation on how to modify and use this script tempaltes for your own purposes.

Furthermore on this repo, all apps installed are fixed to dont conflict with dependencies which is quite tricky, however it worked thx to rbenv, virtualenv and some scripting. 

#### Install routine:

- Part1 Update & Upgrade a blanc 16.04 xubuntu - reboot
- Part2 Install dependencies and base apps, setup user env. - may reboot
- Part3 Install the apps from the main folder categories

When all 3 parts are completed all apps should be installed and working without modifications except personal configs which cant be automated.

After reboot / logout you boot up into the XFCE desktop env as shown on the screen.
